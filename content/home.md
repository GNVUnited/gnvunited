Teachers, School Staff/bus drivers, Parents and families....join us for a socially safe protest and march to demand the SAFE Re-opening of our schools. Our superintendent and school board does NOT have a solid plan, many other districts are opting to start the school year virtually until the pandemic is under control. We still have MANY UNANSWERED questions and concerns. Show your support and speak your voice so that we can be heard! March by foot or by car! Please share this with as many people as possible!!
